# Blockchain Technology

### Introduction

Blockchain is a system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.

## Why Blockchain

* There are certain issues with the current technology we are using, for example internet has changed technologies it has changed the way business works
   Think about facebook, google , amazon they are all running because of internet. Now internet was meant to be open to everyone but now the internet is actually controlled by few companies.and we don want to have central power because its good now but what about the future?
*  When you do online transactions, lets say if you need to send money to someone you need a bank between, thats not really an issue but think of transaction costs, also time if you do an international transaction it can even take days thats why blockchain comes in with the idea of decentralized applications
