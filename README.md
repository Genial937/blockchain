# Blockchain Technology

### Introduction

Blockchain is a system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.

## Why Blockchain

* There are certain issues with the current technology we are using, for example internet has changed technologies it has changed the way business works
   Think about facebook, google , amazon they are all running because of internet. Now internet was meant to be open to everyone but now the internet is actually controlled by few companies.and we dont want to have central power because its good now but what about the future?
*  When you do online transactions, lets say if you need to send money to someone you need a bank between, thats not really an issue but think of transaction costs, also time if you do an international transaction it can even take days thats why blockchain comes in with the idea of [decentralized](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp#:~:text=Decentralized%20applications%E2%80%94also%20known%20as,interference%20of%20a%20single%20authority) applications.
* Blockchain also gives you trust, because every transaction you do online blockchaim saves it on ledger
  If you have a ledger there and you are storying alot of transactions, we dont want it to be changed  we want every transaction to be saved in the same way for longer time and it should not be changed . we want it be immutable and blockchain does provide that
* Secure,, the entire blochain system works on cryptography

## Who should get into blockchain

* Developers
* Experts


## Prerequisites

* [cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7vmouDOJYM) - Cryptography, or cryptology, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior [more resources](https://www.udemy.com/course/du-cryptography/)
* [Distributed computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajjOEltiZm4) - A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another from any system.
